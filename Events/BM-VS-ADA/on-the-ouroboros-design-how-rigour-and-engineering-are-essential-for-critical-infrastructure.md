# On the Ouroboros Design: How rigour and engineering are essential for critical infrastructure  
# 关于Ouroboros的设计：严谨性和工程性对于关键基础设施至关重要


A [blog post][1] on the Steemit website appeared recently making a number of claims regarding [Ouroboros][2]. The article contains several factual inaccuracies. For instance, it is claimed that "DPOS" in the Ouroboros paper stands for "delegated proof of stake", while in fact, DPOS means "dynamic proof of stake", or that the protocol requires a "2/3+" ratio of parties being honest, while in reality it just requires an honest majority, i.e. the stake controlled by parties following the protocol is more than half the total stake.     
最近在Steemit上有一篇[博文][1]对于[Ouroboros][2]有很多论断.这篇文章有很多事实性的错误. 例如, 它论断 Ouroboros 论文中的“DPOS” 是代表 “delegated proof of stake”, 而事实上, DPOS 是代表 “dynamic proof of stake”, 再者它认为协议需要“2/3以上”的诚实节点，事实上只需要大多数诚实节点就可以了, 也就是说. 遵守协议的节点的股权之和只要大于全部股权就可以了.   

For the benefit of those that are interested in the Ouroboros protocol and who appreciate its general philosophy, we feel it is appropriate to provide here a response to this article making along the way a few broader points. While pointing out inaccuracies in the blog, we take the opportunity to highlight some of the general approaches followed in the design of Ouroboros and in the related research efforts that are currently underway at IOHK.  
对于那些对Ouroboros协议感兴趣并认同其基本理念的朋友，我们认为有必要在此深入地回应这篇文章
. 除了指出博文中不准确的地方，我们也借此机会着重介绍我们按照Ouroboros的设计所做的大体工作以及我们在IOHK正在进行的相关研究。

Ouroboros is a proof of stake (PoS) protocol that uses delegation in the spirit of the PoS idea as discussed in the [Bitcoin forum starting from 2011][3]. The references that influenced its design are listed in our paper. PoS is a powerful concept that has inspired a number of other efforts prior, concurrent and post the first Ouroboros paper. Among all other implemented PoS blockchain systems that carry real assets, Ouroboros is unique in that it was designed in tandem with a formal security model and a mathematical proof that it implements a robust transaction ledger. This marks a fundamental shift in the methodology of blockchain system design.  
Ouroboros是我们本着在[2011年比特币论坛][3]上讨论过的PoS想法的精神所创造的使用了委托的股权权益证明 (PoS) 协议. 我们的论文列举了影响它的设计的相关的参考. PoS 是一个强大的概念，对我们第一次发表Ouroboros论文之前之间和之后的相关工作有很大启发。  在所有其他已经实现了PoS的有真实价值的区块链系统中，Ouroboros的独特之处在于它是基于一个形式化的安全模型以及一个被数学证明了的健壮的交易账本的. 这标志着在区块链系统设计的方法论上有了根本性的转变

Blockchain systems are in a period of transition from curiosities to critical infrastructure; as such, the all too typical software industry approach of releasing a "minimum viable product" as early as possible and then fixing bugs as they appear, is not appropriate. Failures of critical infrastructure have a significant impact on people's lives and thus require rigorous engineering discipline to the highest possible standards. Dependability, rather than maximum performance according to some arbitrarily chosen metric, is the primary goal. Performance is important, of course, but the performance required is a function of the ultimate application domain, and from the point of view of dependability it is the worst-case performance that is important, not the ideal-scenario peak rate.  
区块链系统正从未知到关键基础设施阶段过渡;因此，所有过于典型的软件工程的方法，例如尽快发布一个“最小可工作的产品”然后修复问题，已经不太适用了. 关键基础设施的故障会对民众的的生活造成巨大冲击因此需要严格的工程规范以尽可能实现最高标准.  可靠性而非达到随意制定的标准的最大性能才是主要目标。性能当然非常重要，但是性能要求是最终应用领域的一个功能，而且从可靠性的角度而言，最差情况下的性能才是最重要的，而非理想情况下的峰值。

Like all other protocols in the blockchain space, Ouroboros requires some degree of synchronisation. The block production interval has to be consistent with the likely time to complete the required information exchanges. The 20-second slot time in Ouroboros represents a conservative choice for a block of transactions to traverse the diameter of a peer-to-peer network, where the peers may be significantly geographically distributed, the system is operating at peak transaction load and the interconnection is significantly less than perfect. It is improbable for a block of transactions to consistently traverse a global network much faster than that, and as a result any solution that does significantly better (or claims to do significantly better) is either wrong, or provides a weaker level of decentralisation or security, i.e. it solves an easier problem than Ouroboros. There is a tradeoff between achieving a robust, global, participatory service that delivers sustained effective performance even under an adversarial attack, and creating a high performance, limited participation (in geographical scope or network resource requirement) solution that makes overly optimistic assumptions on network stability.  
和所有区块链领域的其他协议一样，Ouroboros需要一定程度的同步性. 出块周期必须保持与接近完成必要信息交换的时间一致. Ouroboros中20秒的时间段长度对于装满交易的区块跨越P2P网络的边界是相当保守的，因为节点可以是在地理上距离非常远，系统在交易高峰期时的互联性是远称不上完美的. 装满交易的区块能保持比这个数字快得多的速度穿越全球性的网络是不大可能的，因此任何能极大地改善或者号称能极大改善的方案要么就是错的，要么只提供了低标准的去中心能力或者安全性，比方说它只是解决了一个比Ouroboros简单的问题. 是要达成一个健壮的全员参与的即使在遭受攻击也能持续有效工作的服务，还是要创建一个高性能的部分人参与的（地理上或者资源上）但需要对网络稳定性保持过度乐观的方案，这两者之间需要权衡。

Irreversibility, the property that transactions persist and are immutable in a blockchain protocol, has to be presented as a function of the level of the adversarial strength. This is true in Nakamoto's Bitcoin paper and also in the [Ouroboros paper][2], see Section 10.1 for the actual time needed for confirmation of transactions. Thus, one should be very wary of statements about irreversibility that do not quantify the level of adversarial power. For instance, Ouroboros will confirm a transaction with 99.9% assurance in just five minutes against an adversary holding 10% of the total stake, which in today's market cap in the Cardano blockchain would amount to more than two billion dollars. Byzantine agreement protocols can provide a more "black and white" irreversibility, in other words the protocol can be guaranteed to be irreversible within a certain time window provided an honest majority or supermajority exists depending on the protocol. Nevertheless, the performance and decentralisation penalty suffered is very high if the level of adversity is allowed to come close to the 1/2 barrier, which is the level of adversity that Ouroboros can withstand.  
不可逆性，即交易在区块链协议中保持不变的属性，是体现抗攻击强度的一个必要的功能. 在中本聪的比特币论文以及[Ouroboros 论文][2]都是如此，参见章节10.1中交易确认的实际时间的内容 . 因此，有关不可逆性的言论，如果不能量化抗攻击级别，则需要对之保持警惕. 例如，Ouroboros能99.9%的保证在五分钟内能抵抗住持有10%股权的攻击者，这个份额在今天相当于20多亿美元的市值. Byzantine共识协议能提供“非黑即白”的不可逆性，换句话说，根据协议只要在某个时间窗口内大多数或者绝大多数节点是诚实的，协议就能保证不可逆性. 然而，抗攻击级别一旦能达到接受一半攻击者的界线，这也是目前Ouroboros所能承受的，性能和去中心程度会遭受极大的压力

The issue of possible dominance of the consensus process by a small group of stakeholders holding a large proportion of the stake is important but is not applicable to the current release of the Cardano system (the Byron release). What we have proved for Ouroboros is that it can facilitate a "fair" transaction ledger (where fairness here means that the ledger can fairly record all significant actions that are performed by the protocol participants despite the presence of an adversary). This enabled us to neutralise a number of rational protocol deviations (e.g. the equivalent of selfish mining attacks in the PoS setting) and provide a Nash equilibrium argument showing how the protocol can support many different types of mechanisms for incentivising participant behaviour. Currently, IOHK Research is actively working to finalise the incentive structure that will be incorporated in the Shelley release of Cardano, where stake pools will be supported and delegation behaviour will be properly incentivised so that it offers effective decentralisation of power. The crux of our methodology is the engineering of a novel reward mechanism for rational participants that provides appropriate incentives to partition their delegation rights. The objectives are first, to avoid concentration of power to a small group of participants – as it could happen by a naïve reward mechanism in a Pareto distributed stakeholder population – and second, to provide appropriate incentives to ensure a desired number of delegates. We are very excited about this work; it will be the first of its kind in the area and, as before, we will be disseminating it widely including full technical details, as well as submitting it for peer review.  
 共识过程可能被少部分持有大比例大股权的持有者控制的问题是非常重要的，但是这在当前Cardano系统的版本（Byron版本）上是没法应用的. 我们已经证明的是Ouroboros可以很方便地演变成一个公平的交易账本（这里的公平是指即使有攻击者存在的情况下，账本仍可以公平地记录所有被协议参与者执行的关键步骤）.  这使我们可以平衡一些合理的协议上的差异（例如：相当于在PoS环境下的自私的挖矿行为）并提供Nash均衡的论证来说明能够提供许多不同类型的激励机制给不同行为的参与者. 当前，IOHK研究院正积极地最终确认将集成进Shelley版本中的激励机制，它将支持股权池且会正确地激励委托行为从而提供有效的去中心的动力.  我们方法论的关键在于为理性参与者设计一种新颖的奖励机制，为合理分配委托权提供适当的激励.  目标首先是避免力量集中在一小组参与者手中，因为不成熟的奖励机制会导致在Pareto分布的股权持有者群体中此问题的发生，其次提供一个合适的激励制度来保证有足够数量的代表。我们非常高兴这个是可行的；它将是该领域的首创，与以前一样，我们将广泛传播，包括完整的技术细节，并提交给同行

This brings us to the final distinguishing advantage of the philosophy of Cardano. Scientific peer review has been refined over centuries. The way it is implemented by the [International Cryptology Conference][4] (also called Crypto), where Ouroboros was presented, and the other top conferences in the area, strives to remove conflicts of interest and produce the highest level of objectivity. The method of reviewing is known as "double blind", i.e. papers are submitted anonymously and reviewers are experts that also remain anonymous to the authors. The committee of experts that reviews submitted papers each year is formed by two program co-chairs that are appointed by the [International Association of Cryptologic Research][5], the pre-eminent organisation of cryptology research that was founded in 1982.  
这些给我们的Cardano哲学带来最终的独一无二的优势。 科学同行评审已经完善了几个世纪。 被[国际密码学会议][4]（也称Crypto），也是Ouroboros被提交上去的组织，和其他顶级会议所实施的方式，力求消除利益冲突，并产生最高级别的客观性。 评审的方法被称为“双盲”，即文件是被匿名提交的，评审人也是对作者匿名的专家。 每年评审提交论文的专家委员会由两名由[国际密码学研究协会][5]指定的项目联合主席组成，该组织成立于1982年，是密码学研究领域的杰出组织。


Being invited to serve in the committee as an expert is an important recognition of an individual's long-term commitment to the area of cryptography (and even a precise count of how many times one has served is [maintained][6]). Blockchain protocols fit perfectly within the cryptography scientific literature and thus scientific peer review is to be done by this community. Of course, we welcome reviews from anyone. That is why we make public very detailed whitepapers with precise and specific claims that leave no uncertainty about what is being claimed, and we appreciate any factual discussion about any of these claims. We strongly encourage other projects to submit their work for scientific peer review as well. They will enjoy the benefits of thorough, well-founded and objective critique and they will have the opportunity to showcase any advantages and novelty that their approach possesses.  
被邀请进委员会担任专家是个人长期致力于密码学领域的很重要的认可（甚至可以精确地指出一个人(服务)[6]了多少次）。 区块链协议完全符合密码学科学文献，因此同行科学评审将由该社区完成。 当然，我们欢迎任何人的评论。 这就是为什么我们公开了非常详细的白皮书，并提供确切而具体的声明以确保声明的内容不会产生不确定性，我们也非常感谢任何有关这些声明的实质性的讨论。 我们强烈鼓励其他项目也提交他们的作品进行同行科学评审。 他们将享受彻底的，有根据的和客观的批评带来的好处，他们也将有机会展示他们方法的所有优势和创新。
